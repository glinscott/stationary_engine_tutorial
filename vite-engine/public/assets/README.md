# Asset Bundle

This directory contains the GLB and animation data used by the tutorial (`edges.glb`, `occ2node.json`, `motion.json.gz`, etc.).

After running the converter pipeline, copy the outputs from `out/` into this folder and commit the changes so production builds on GitHub Pages have everything they need.
